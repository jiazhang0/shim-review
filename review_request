[Purpose of Use]

certificated hardware with UEFI Secure Boot enabled, so it is good for the
user experence without manual provision if the delivered shim binary is
already pre-signed by Microsoft Corporation UEFI CA 2011.

[Patches applied]
See patch directory for the details.

Notes:
- Patch 2,3 are dedicated for Pulsar Linux build environment so they
won't be submitted.
- Patch 1 is also dedicated for Pulsar Linux because the EV certificate
issued by the authority "WoSign" uses SHA-1 for the signature algorithm.
We already urged WoSign to issue a new EV certificate using SHA-256 and
will purchase it after current EV certificate expires.
