Subject: [PATCH 10/11] Makefile: do not sign the efi file

Shim tries to sign all the efi binaries at build time, but is not
suitable for us. Because the private key has to be supplied, and this
doesn't make sense to EDSS key.

We will use a seperated function in bitbake file to
sign these efi binaries, so that we can freely use EDSS key, Wind
River sample key or user key.
